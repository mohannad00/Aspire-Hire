These principles establish practices for developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending it as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also help avoid code smells, refactor code, and develop Agile or Adaptive software.

SOLID stands for:

S - Single-responsibility Principle
O - Open-closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
In this article, you will be introduced to each principle individually to understand how SOLID can help make you a better developer.

Single-Responsibility Principle
Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

For example, consider an application that takes a collection of shapes‚Äîcircles and squares‚Äîand calculates the sum of the area of all the shapes in the collection.

First, create the shape classes and have the constructors set up the required parameters.

For squares, you will need to know the length of a side:
